# GoodCall-Work-in-Progress
GoodCall is a group decision maker app where friend groups can create a group chat and send secure random events to one another to help with tiny decisions. For example you can send a coin flip to your friend group that will either be heads or tails. The app is a work in progress and currently only has capabilities for coin flip and choosing a random member from the group.

The project was made in Android Studio using Kotlin and Firebase realtime database.
